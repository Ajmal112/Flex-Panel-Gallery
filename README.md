# Flex Panel Gallery

## Introduction
The Flex Panel Gallery is a web page created using CSS that showcases a collection of five images in a visually appealing layout. Each image panel is designed to expand and display additional content when clicked, creating an interactive and engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Image Expansion**: Clicking on an image panel triggers an animation that expands the selected image, providing a closer view for users to explore.
- **Overflowing Text**: The expanded image panel includes text content that overflows along the Y-axis, creating an elegant visual effect and ensuring readability of longer text passages.
- **Responsive Design**: The Flex Panel Gallery is built using CSS flexbox, allowing the layout to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users.
